### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    computer could store an input that the user gave and use it for a game.
    I was able to write different if statements which decided the outcome
    of the game based on user inputs.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was a favorite because it taught me how to use different
    elements from the same vector. I was able to write functions dealing
    with the different elements from the vector which helped my understanding
    of vectors a lot.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how you
    could create an image by just using code. I was able to write functions
    using the knowledge I learned within class which led to a successful
    image showing up on screen.
